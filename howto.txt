how to commit/make changes to the project

add files/make changes to app file/text file whatever
send new changes to the "main" folder in file explorer
(drag n drop new file)

*this is the directory for our repository!

open up Git GUI (Github, etc. im using Sourcetree for some reason, but both do the same thing!)

should see new changed file(s) in the left column under Changes
make sure the file is checked off 

add a description of the new change in the bottom text box
click commit!

last thing is to make sure that you push the change, so it changes on all repositories!
now the new file(s) have been added to all of our computers!

follow the same steps for removing files from the repository as well!
